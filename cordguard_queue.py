CordGuard Queue Module

This module provides a persistent queue implementation for the CordGuard application.
The CordGuardQueue class extends Python's built-in Queue to add disk persistence,
automatically saving queue state between program restarts.

Key features:
- Persistent storage of queue items using pickle serialization
- Automatic state saving after modifications
- Configurable maximum queue size
- Full Queue interface (put, get, task_done, etc.)
- Thread-safe operations inherited from Queue

The queue state is stored in a pickle file in the same directory as this module.
This allows the application to maintain its queue state across restarts and crashes,
providing reliability for long-running queue operations.

Example usage:
    queue = CordGuardQueue(maxsize=20)
    queue.put("task1")
    item = queue.get()
    queue.task_done()

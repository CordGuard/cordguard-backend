CordGuard Core Module

This module provides core functionality for the CordGuard application, including:
- FastAPI application initialization and configuration 
- Asynchronous DATABASE initialization
- File analysis processing
- Background task management

The module serves as the central coordinator between different components of the
CordGuard system, handling application setup and file analysis workflows.

Key Components:
    - FastAPI application initialization
    - Database connection management
    - Asynchronous queue consumer
    - File analysis orchestration
